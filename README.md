👋 Hi, I am Oumaima Edaou, welcome to my github profile. \
I am motivated to explore complex datasets and discover valuable informations to make data-driven decisions. I am passionate about:
🔍 Data Analysis: Armed with an eye for detail, I dive deep into the data, clean it up and prepare it for analysis. I like to unravel trends and correlations that lead to achievable conclusions.
📊 Data visualization: I think data is more powerful when presented visually. I like to design data visualizations that communicate ideas clearly, making data more accessible to stakeholders.
🤖 Data Science: As a data scientist I am constantly working on my machine learning and predictive modeling skills. I like to discover the latest algorithms and developing models to address real-world challenges.
